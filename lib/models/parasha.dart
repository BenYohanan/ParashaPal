Summary of Noach (Genesis 6:9 - 11:32)

Parasha:

The Noach parasha primarily focuses on the story of Noah and the Great Flood. It begins with Yahweh observing the corruption and violence that had spread among humanity. Noah, however, is found righteous, and Yahweh chooses him to build an ark to save himself, his family, and representatives of each kind of animal.

Yahweh establishes a covenant with Noah, symbolized by the rainbow, promising never to destroy the earth again in this manner.

The parasha then provides a genealogy of Noah's descendants, which leads to the story of the Tower of Babel.
