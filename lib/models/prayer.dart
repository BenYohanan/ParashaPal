ENGLISH:  Psalm 92

Psalm or Song for the Sabbath day.

It is a good thing to give thanks unto Yahweh, and to sing praises unto thy name, oh most-High: To show forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night. Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound. For thou, Yahweh hast made me glad through thy works! I will triumph in the works of thy hands. O Yahweh, how great are thy works! And thy thoughts are very deep. 
A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understands this. When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed forever: But thou, Yahweh, art most high for evermore For, lo, thine enemies, O Yahweh, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. 
But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil Mine eye also shall see my desire on my enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me. The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. Those that be planted in the house of Yahweh shall flourish in the courts of our Elohim. 
They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing; To show that Yahweh is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

DAILY AMIDOTH: ENGLISH

(As in ancient times the Amidah is said 3x daily Morning, afternoon, and evening while standing: Note: -Take three steps backwards beginning with the left foot. Then take three steps forward beginning with the right foot. Keep the two heels together forming a V”. This section of the prayer is called Shemonei Esrei or the Amidah. One is presumed to be standing in front of his Creator. Thus maximum concentration and humility are expected. There should be no distractions. You should not move until the conclusion of the Shemounel. Make sure you are facing the East and ensure that nobody walks across your face during this section of prayers.)

ENGLISH

O my sovereign, open my lips, that my mouth may tell forth your praise. Blessed are you, YHWH our Elohim and Elohim of our fathers, Elohim of Abraham, Elohim of Yitzchak, Elohim of Ya’akob; the great, mighty and awesome Elohim, the most-high Elohim, 
who bestows steadfast love and goodness and is master of all, and remembers the good deeds of the fathers, and will in love bring a redeemer to their children, for the sake of his name. O king, helper, saviour, and shield, blessed are you, YHWH, the shield of Abraham. You are mighty forever, O YHWH, you bring to life the dead, you are mighty to save. You sustain the living with steadfast love, you bring the dead to life with great mercy; you support all who fall and heal the sick; you free the captives and are faithful to those who sleep in the dust. Who is like you, sovereign of mighty? Who can be compared to you, O king? You cause death and cause life, and make your salvation flourish. Yes, you are faithful to bring the dead to life. Blessed are you, O YHWH, who raises the dead. You are separated and your name is separated, and the chosen ones praise your name every day. Blessed are you, O YHWH, set apart Elohim.

ALEYNU: ENGLISH

It is incumbent upon us to praise the master of all, to exalt the creator of the world for he has made us distinct from the nations and unique among the families of the earth. Our destiny is not like theirs, our calling is our task. We bow down and acknowledge before the king of kings that there is none like him. For he stretched forth the heavens like a tent and established the earth. Truly there is none like our Mighty one and king. As the Torah says, “You shall know this day and reflect in your heart that it is YHWH who is Mighty one in the heavens above and on the earth beneath, there is none else”. We hope. O YHWH our Mighty one, to soon behold your majestic splendour when all abominations shall be removed and all idolatry shall be at an end. Then shall the world be perfected under the rule of YHWH Almighty and all mankind shall call upon your name. For to you, every knee must bow and every tongue declares that you are Mighty one. Reign over us soon and forever. May the kingdom of David’s greater son be established forever. For then shall the words be fulfilled “YHWH shall be King forever” and, “YHWH shall be king over all the earth; on that day YHWH shall be one, and his name one”.

You have set us apart by your commandments and taken pleasure in us, and in love and favour, you have caused us to inherit the Shabbat, a memorial of the creation, a day which is the beginning of our gatherings and is a memorial of our departure from Mits'rayim. For you have chosen us and have set us apart from all peoples, and in love and in favour, you have caused us to inherit the Shabbat. Blessed are you, O YHWH, who sets apart the Shabbath.

YIGDAL: ENGLISH

Exalt the living mighty one and praise him. He exists without time, Elohim’s existence is eternal. He is unique, and no oneness is like his oneness. He has no semblance of a body, nor anybody. Nothing compares to his separation. He was before all things which were created. He was first, without beginning. He is sovereign eternal, and all creatures declare his greatness and kingship. Abundant prophesy He gave to the men of his choice and there never arose in Yisrael one as Mosheh prophet and beholder of his image. The Torah of truth He gave to his people. Mighty one gave it through his prophet, his faithful servant. Elohim will not replace, nor change his law forever for any other. He inspects and knows our secrets, He perceives the end of things at their birth. He rewards the righteous man for his deeds. He gives to the evil, evil for his deeds. At the end of the day, He will send our anointed one, to save those who wait for his final help. The dead, Elohim will revive in great mercy. Blessed forever and ever be his name and his esteem.

Sovereign of the world, the supreme ruler, before all creation, came to be. When by his will all things were wrought, the Name of our king was first made known. And when this age shall cease to be, he still shall reign in majesty. He was, He is, and He will be in all his splendour eternally. Incomparable, YHWH is one without beginning, and without end, unto him all strength and majesty. He is my living powerful one, who saves, my rock when grief or sorrows befall, my banner and my strong refuge. My cup of life whenever I call and in his hands, I place my life both when I sleep and when I wake. And with my soul and my body too, YHWH is with me; there is no fear.

Save us for thy name’s sake. Be thou a shield about us. Remove from us every enemy, pestilence, sword, famine, and sorrow. Remove also the adversary from before us and from behind us. O shelter us beneath the shadow of thy wings; for thou, O powerful one, are a gracious and merciful king. Guard our going out and our coming in unto life and unto peace from this time forth and for evermore; yea, spread over us the tabernacle of thy peace.

With you is the fountain of life, in your light do I see light.

I will rejoice for He has made me glad.

YAH IN THE MORNING

1. Yah in the morning, thou shall hear
My voice ascending high,
To thee will I direct my prayers
To thee lift up my eyes.

To plead for all his Saints,
Presenting at his father's throne
Our songs and our complaints.

3. Oh, may thy spirit guide my feet
In ways of righteousness
make every path of duty straight,
And plain before my face

4. The men that love and fear thy Name
Shall see their hopes fulfilled,
The Mighty Yah will compass them
With favour as with a shield.

13.  And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love Yahweh your Elohim, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul. 
14. That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. 
15. And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.
16. Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other Elohim, and worship them;
17.  And then Yahweh’s wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield, not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which Yahweh giveth you. 
I8. Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes. 
19. And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. 
20. And thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thine house, and upon thy gates.
21. That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which Yahweh sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth. 

NUM. 15:37-41,
37. And Yahweh spake unto Moses, saying:
38. Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue: 
39. And it shall be unto you for a fringe that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of Yahweh, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after Which ye use to go a whoring: 
40. That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your Elohim. 
41. I am Yahweh your Elohim, which brought you out of the Land of Egypt, to be your Elohim: I am Yahweh your Elohim. 

Elohim Asher
Hebrews 1: 1-3 affirmation of Messiah’s person.
1. Elohim, who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, 
2. Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; 
3. Who being the brightness of his splendour, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;

This is the praise of the Shabbat day, that the mighty one rested thereon from all His work when the Shabbat day itself offered praise and said it is good to give thanks unto YHWH.

1. It is a good thing to give thanks unto Yahweh, and to sing praises, unto thy name, O most High:
2. To show forth thy loving kindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,
3. Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.
4. For thou, Yahweh, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
5. O Yahweh, how great are thy works! And thy thoughts are v very deep.
6. A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understands this.
7. When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed forever:
8. But thou, Yahweh, art most high for evermore.
9. For, lo, thine enemies, O Yahweh, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
10. But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of a unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.
11. my eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire o the wicked that rise up against me.
12. The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
13. Those that be planted in the house of Yahweh shall flourish in the courts of our Elohim.
14. They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;
15. To show that Yahweh is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

(As in ancient times the Amidah is said 3x daily Morning, afternoon and evening while standing: Note: Take three steps backward, beginning with the left foot. Then take three steps forward, beginning with the right foot. Keep the two heels together, forming a "V." This section of the prayer is called Shemonei Esrei, or the Amidah. One is presumed to be standing in front of his Creator. Thus, maximum concentration and humility are expected. There should be no distractions. You should not move until at the conclusion of the Shemounel. Make sure you are facing the East and ensure that nobody walks across your face during this section of prayers.)

"The children of Yisrael shall observe the Shabbat, to practice the Shabbat throughout their generations as an everlasting covenant. It is a sign between me and the children of Yisrael forever, because in six days YHWH made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested and refrained from his work." You did not give the Shabbat, YHWH our Elohim, to the other nations of the earth. It is not the heritage of those who serve idols. Pagans do not rejoice in its rest. To Yisrael, your people, you gave it in love, to the descendants of Ya'akob, whom you chose in love. May the people who set apart the seventh, all of them, be satisfied and delighted with your goodness. You favoured the seventh day and set it apart; the desirable days you called it, in memory of you in creation.

Blessed are you, YHWH, who has given us the way of salvation in the anointed one, Yahoshua. He walked among us filled with your spirit, the only one who ever fulfilled your Torah. He healed the sick and raised the dead. The multitudes of our people sought his touch. He taught as no man taught. With authority, he brought forth the treasures of the Torah. How the children sought him, the lepers he touched and made clean! How the despised and outcast found love and release from their sin. How the hypocrites feared him whose words uncovered their sin, despised and rejected, acquainted with grief, he bore the sins of Yisrael. All we like sheep have gone astray turned everyone to his own way. Our iniquities were laid upon the king, the sins of the world, his burden to bear. He rose from the dead and opened the way to life everlasting, praise his name. We are in him, his spirit empowers us; new life is ours with joy and peace.

As for Him, his way is perfect: the word of YHWH is tried: he is a shield unto all them that trust in him.

O YHWH, the Elohim of Abraham Yits’chak and of Yisrael Our Father, guard this forever as the impulse of the thoughts of the hearts of your people and direct their hearts to Yourself and he is merciful and forgives Iniquity and does not destroy. Often times, he turned away his anger and did not stir up all his wrath. For you, YHWH is good and forgiving, abounding in lovingkindness to all who call upon him. Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and your Torah is truth. You will give truth to Ya'akob and lovingkindness to Abraham, as you swore to our fathers in the days of old. Blessed is YHWH; day by day he carries our burden; the Elohim of our salvation, Selah YHWH ts'baot, is with us; a stronghold for us is the Elohim of Ya'akob, Selah YHWH ts'baot; happy is the man who trusts in you. YHWH, Save! May the King answer us on the day we call. Blessed is Our Elohim who created us for his Splendour and has divided us from those who Stray and gave us the Torah of truth, and planted life everlasting in Our midst. May he open our hearts to the Torah and place in us his love and his fear so as to do his will and to serve him with a perfect heart that we might not labour for nothing and not bring forth confusion. May it be your will, YHWH Elohim. Elohim of Our fathers that we might keep your statutes in this world and be Worthy to live and see and inherit good and blessing in the time of the days of Hamashiach and in the life of the world to come That my life might sing your praise, and not be silent, YHWH my Elohim forever will I thank you. Blessed the man who trusts in YHWH and for Whom YHWH is his trust. Trust in YHWH forever and ever because YHWH is an everlasting rock, and those Who trust in you know your name, for You have not forsaken them that seek You. YHWH was pleased for the sake of his righteousness to magnify and make the Torah great: There is none like You, favourable and merciful YHWH. Our Elohim, there is none like You, slow to anger and great in faithful love and truth. Save us in your great mercy.

(As in ancient times the Amidah is said 3x daily Morning, afternoon, and evening while standing: Note: Take three steps backwards beginning with the left foot. Then take three steps forward beginning with the right foot. Keep the two heels together forming a “V’. This section of the prayer is called Shemonei Esrei or the Amidah. One is presumed to be standing in front of his Creator. Thus maximum concentration and humility is expected. There should be no distractions. You should not move until the conclusion of the Shemounel. Make sure you are facing the East and ensure that nobody walks across your face during this section of prayers.)

PSALM 104 

1.	Bless Yahweh, O my soul! O Yahweh my Elohim, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty. 
2.	Who covers thyself with light as with a garment who stretches out the heavens like a curtain: 
3.	Who layeth the beams of his chambers on the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: Who walketh upon the wings of the wind: 
4.	Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire: 
5.	who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed forever.
6.	Thou covered it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains. 
7.	At your rebuke, they fled; at the voice of your thunder, they hastened away.
8.	They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them. 
9.	Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth. 
10.	He sends the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.
11.	They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild asses quench their thirst.
12.	By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, Which sing among the branches. 
13.	He waters the hills from his chambers; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of your works.
14.	He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth; 
15.	And Wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread Which strengtheneth man’s heart. 
16.	The trees of Yahweh are full of sap. the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted;

ALEYNU; ENGLISH

It is incumbent upon us to praise the master of all, to exalt the creator of the world, for he has made us distinct from the nations and unique among the families of the earth. Our destiny is not like theirs, our calling is our task. We bow down and acknowledge before the king of kings that there is none like him. For he stretched forth the heavens like a tent and established the earth. Truly there is none like our Mighty one and king. As the Torah says, "You shall know this day and reflect in your heart that it is YHWH who is the Mighty One in the heavens above and on the earth beneath, there is none else." We hope, O YHWH, our Mighty One, to soon behold your majestic splendour when all abominations shall be removed and all idolatry shall come to an end. Then shall the world be perfected under the rule of YHWH Almighty, and all mankind shall call upon your name. For to you, every knee must bow and every tongue declares that you are Mighty one. reign over us soon and forever. May the kingdom of Dawid’s greater son be established forever. For then shall the words be fulfilled, "YHWH shall be King forever" and, "YHWH shall be king over all the earth; on that day YHWH shall be one, and his name one."

YAG’DAL: ENGLISH

Exalt the living, mighty one, and praise him. He exists without time, Elohim’s existence is eternal. He is unique, and no oneness is like his oneness. He has no semblance of a body, nor anybody. Nothing compares to his separation. He was before all things that were created. He was first, without beginning. He is Sovereign and Eternal, and all creatures declare his greatness and kingship. Abundant prophesy he gave to the men of his choice and there never arose in Yisrael one as Mosheh, a prophet and beholder of his image. The Torah of truth he gave to his people. The mighty one gave it through his prophet, his faithful servant. Elohim will not replace nor change his law forever for any other. He inspects and knows our secrets; he perceives the end of things at their birth. He rewards the righteous man for his deeds. He gives to the evil, evil for his deeds. At the end of the day, he will send our anointed one to save those who wait for his final help. The dead, Elohim will revive in great mercy. Blessed forever and ever be his name and his esteem.

2.	My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.
3.	Yahweh, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him of the son of man, that thou makest account of him!
4.	Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away.
5.	Bow thy heavens, O Yahweh, and come down; touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
6.	Cast forth lightning, and scatter them; shoot out your arrows, and destroy them.
7.	Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;
8.	Whose mouth speakeft1 vanity and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
9.	I will sing a new song unto thee, O Elohim: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.
10.	It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.
11.	Rid me and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaks vanity and their right hand is the right hand of falsehood.
12.	That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as cornerstones, polished after the similitude of a palace: 
13.	That our garners may be full, affording all manner of the store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousand in our streets: 
14.	That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, no going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.

We beseech you, O YHWH, in the name of the anointed one, Yahoshua.

VERSES OF BLESSING
HEBREW

The Rabbi Or Priest Recites This After Havdala.

ENGLISH

May YHWH give you the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and wine. People will serve you and nations bow down to you. Be master over your brothers, and may your mother’s Sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you, and blessed be everyone who blesses you. El Shaddai

ENGLISH

YHWH bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, so that you may become a company of people. May He give the blessings of Abraham to you and to your descendants with you, that you may take possession of the land of your sojournings which Elohim gave to Abraham! From the Elohim of your fathers (Abraham etc.) who will help you; by El Shaddai YHWH who will bless you with the blessings of the breasts and of the womb. The blessings of your Father are mighty, beyond the blessings of my ancestor, the bounties of the everlasting hills; may they be on your head and the brow of him who was separated from his brothers. 
HE (YHWH) will love you and bless you and multiply you and will bless the fruit of your womb, and the fruit of your ground, your corn and your new wine and your oil, the offspring of your cattle and the young of your flock, in the land which he swore unto your fathers to give you. You shall be blessed above all people there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle. And YHWH will take away from you all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you know, will he inflict upon you, but HE will lay them upon all that hate you. The Malak who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and in them let my name be named upon them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Yitscak; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. YHWH, your Elohim has multiplied you, and behold, you are this day as the stars of heaven for a thousand times so many more as you are, and bless you as are, and bless you as he has promised you! 
Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be in the field. Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you be when you go out. Blessed shall be your basket and your kneading trough. Blessed shall be the fruit of your body and the fruit of your ground, and the fruit of your breasts, the increase of your cattle, and the young of your flock. YHWH will command the blessing upon you in your barns and in all that you undertake, and He will bless you in the land that YHWH your Elohim gives you. YHWH will open to you his good treasure, the heaven, to give the rain unto your land in its season, and to bless all the work of your hand; and you shall lend unto many nations, but you shall not borrow. For YHWH your Mighty One will bless you, as he promised you, and you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow; and you shall rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over you. 
Happy are you, O Yisrael! Who is like you, a people saved by YHWH the shield of your help, and the sword of your triumph! Your enemies shall come bowing to you, and you shall tread upon their high places.
